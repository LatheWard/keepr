# Keepr
## A simple time-keeping-and-issue-scribing-tool

I usually have a formatted excel sheet for work, but I wanted to keep up with my
time across projects more programmatically.

I wanted something simple, free, and dedicated to these 2 purposes:
keeping time and keeping organized notes with stamps.

I plan on continually updating this to be as available as possible across OSes.

This probably should have been written in C.
